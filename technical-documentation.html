            <header><h2>Set the Ground Rules</h2></header>
            <p>It’s hard to get on the documentation bandwagon when it’s not clear to you
                and your team what to document or how you want it to work. So the first step 
                is to agree on which conventions you’ll use and how you should implement 
                them. You can do this in a live document so everybody on the team can 
                contribute. In this way, as your approach changes or becomes more 
                comprehensive, you can keep it up-to-date. A shared Google doc, a wiki page 
                on your code repo, or (even better) a page on your “living style guide” are 
                all great places for this.</p>
                <p>Now let’s looks at the actual “ground rules” that you can include.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="structure">
            <header><h2>Explain the Structure of your Code Base</h2></header>
            <p>Understanding how your code is organized allows anybody to jump straight into 
                the action from day one. A simple way of doing this is creating a map of your 
                file structure where you can explain what’s in it and what should go where. When 
                doing this pay special attention to those places where there could be ambiguity. 
                For instance, indicating that the file “buttons.css” contains styles for buttons 
                is not very helpful, but indicating that the “custom” directory is where custom 
                styles for the theme are located can be a time saver.</p>
            <p>Here’s an example:</p>
            <code>Project Root<br>
            └── srs<br>
            .    ├── styles               // Base styles. Styles placed here should be available 
            anywhere in the application<br>
            .        ├── bootstrap-custom // Custom styles that overwrite bootstrap<br>
            .        ├── custom           // Custom styles created for the application<br>
            .        ├── demos            // Demos to illustrate styles and interactions for the 
            style guide<br>
            .        ├── fonts<br>           
            .        ├── img              // Images used ONLY in stylesheets<br>
            .        ├── variables        // Variables used in the custom theme<br>
            .        └── styles.less      // Imports of all the base stylesheets</code>
            <p>As a rule of thumb, document those places where clarification is needed. Not 
                every directory and file will need documentation (like in the above example 
                “fonts” is self-explanatory). Put yourself in the shoes of somebody new to the 
                project (or remember those times where you were that person) and provide the 
                guidance you wish you would have been given. The idea is to do this in a way 
                that’s not time-consuming for you but is helpful enough to avoid repetitive 
                questions.</p>
            <p>Another key element to point out here is where new styles should be added and
                any steps that should be followed. The example above demonstrates this, but given 
                the inheritance nature of CSS, it can be worthwhile to state it in detail.</p>
            <p>For example, in projects where we used Bootstrap as an underlying framework, we 
                typically have three places where new rules should go, depending on what the developer 
                is trying to achieve. So we added a guide to the documentation comprising 
                three scenarios:</p>
            <p><h3>Scenario #1</h3><br>
                If you want to overwrite a style defined by Bootstrap, then:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find out in which stylesheet of the bootstrap framework the rule is 
                        defined.</li>
                    <li>Go to “src/styles/bootstrap-custom”.</li>
                    <li>Look for the same stylesheet.</li>
                    <li>If it doesn't exist, create a new one in that directory, with the s
                        ame name.</li>
                    <li>Add your overwrite and point out anything of importance.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, import the new stylesheet in “src/styles/style.less”.</li>
                </ol>
            <p><h3>Scenario #2</h3><br>
            If you want to add a new style definition that is not overwriting Bootstrap 
            and that should be available anywhere in the application, then:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to “src/styles/custom”.</li>
                <li>Find a stylesheet where the new style could be added (think: is 
                    this a style for defining a button, or is it a reusable style like a 
                    mixin?) and place it where it makes the most sense.</li>
                <li>If there isn’t a stylesheet where it makes sense to put this new 
                    style, then create a new one.</li>
                <li>Name it following our naming conventions.</li>
                <li>Add your new style and point out anything of importance.</li>
                <li>Lastly, import the new stylesheet in “src/styles/style.less”.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="coding-standards">
            <header><h2>Establishing Your Coding Standards</h2></header>
            <p>Your coding standards or CSS style guide refers to the way your team has agreed 
                on writing CSS. This includes the best practices on writing code, like formatting, 
                naming, and syntax conventions. Many companies have shared the way they do it (this 
                article from CSS-Tricks has a great compilation: CSS Style Guides). Here are a 
                couple of ways I find it useful to share this type of information:</p>
            <p><h3>Don’ts vs. Do’s List</h3><br>
                Use this format to point out the things that you want to avoid, while providing 
                a viable alternative. This removes ambiguity and encourages people to do a 
                specific thing.</p>
            <p><h3>Don’ts vs. Do’s List</h3>>
                Summarize your guidelines into best practices and include examples. This will 
                make each one easier to read and understand.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="long-stylesheets">
            <header><h2>Avoid Long Stylesheets</h2></header>
            <p>When you break your styles into smaller and more focused stylesheets it’s easier
                to document them. You can also save time by not having to document what becomes
                self-explanatory.<br>
                For example, instead of having one 800 line stylesheet with all the variables 
                that you can use in a theme, you can have a file for each of the variable types. 
                This will save time by not having to scroll up and down in the file trying to 
                find something! Think as well of the time that you can save by not having to 
                update the index every time you add or rename a new section.</p>
            <p>Another example to consider when working in large applications is the modlet 
                workflow. It explains why working with smaller files organized by components 
                allows testing and assembling them in your app more easily.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="sections">
            <header><h2>Breakdown Your Stylesheets into Sections</h2></header>
            <p>Once you have broken down your stylesheets into more manageable files, then you 
                can continue this exercise by breaking down each style into individual sections.<br>
                To begin with, each stylesheet should at least include a title and (when useful) 
                a short description. The title could be as simple as the name of the file, 
                capitalized to look more like a title (ex: “Buttons” for the stylesheet 
                “buttons.css”), or it could be the same as the name of the file, like this:<br>
            <code>
                /**<br>
                 * icons.css<br>
                 */<br><br>
                 
                .icon {<br>
                  font-family: 'bitovi';<br>
                  speak: none;<br>
                  font-style: normal;<br>
                  font-weight: normal;<br>
                  font-variant: normal;<br>
                  text-transform: none;<br>
                  line-height: 1;<br>
                }</code></p>
                <p>I find using the filename particularly useful when debugging the code in the 
                    browser, and mostly when the file has been compiled with other files, 
                    as I can get a reference to the file where the style lives.<br></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="index">
            <header><h2>Index the Contents of Your Stylesheets</h2></header>
            <p>This is a great way to provide a snapshot of what’s in the stylesheet and a must 
                in those projects where, for whatever reason, long stylesheets are there to stay 
                (not a fan of those projects, but they do happen!).</p>
            <p>A stylesheet index typically looks like this:</p>
            <code>
                /**<br>
                 * icons.css<br>
                 *<br>
                 * Icons should convey in a simple and meaningful way the concept of the function<br>
                 * they represent. When designing new icons be sure to remove any complexities<br> 
                 * and follow the linear and lightweight appearance of the icon set.<br>
                 *<br>
                 * Index<br>
                 * - Icon Font<br>
                 * - Icon Variations<br>
                 * - Icon Animations<br>
                 *<br>
                 */
            </code>
            <p>And although I love how neat and useful they can be, I have to admit they can be 
                easily forgotten, and therefore outdated. They are also a pain to update when they 
                are long and you are using numerals (so avoid those!)</p>
            <p>An alternative way of using indexes is to let a style guide generator do the work 
                for you by looking at your stylesheets, finding the sections that you have defined 
                and generate an index for you. I will expand more on this topic at the end of this 
                article.</p>
